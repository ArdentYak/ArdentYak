### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently enrolled in the IBM Data Professionals certificate program on Coursera and like the coding aspect, so I've decided to pursue that a little more. 
I'm looking at completing a career change into data analysis within the next year, and gaining more experience on the coding and querying side.

âš¡ Fun Fact: I'm a trained Goldsmith looking at a career change due to workplace injury, market over-saturation, and under-employment within the industry.
